Note on Ramp Unit Test Structure

Ramp is designed to provide two dimensional colour ramp data for the testing of graphics environments.

This uses a simple linear range algorithm to specify colours in a given range - this could be more precise if required.

The supplied tests excercise the following conditions:

 1) Edge cases
 2) Minimal linear range
 3) Error cases

The linear range tests use known size to allow for simple assertion of correct operation.

Developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (no extra packages required).
